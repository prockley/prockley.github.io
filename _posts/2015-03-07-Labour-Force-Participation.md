###Gender comparison using 2011 Census data (ages 25-54)

The purpose of this post was to get an idea of the geographic distribution of participation rates over the whole country. The data was restricted to the 25-54 age group to highlight the times when people are most likely to be working and rearing a family.  

__Labour force participation rate:__ _The labour force (those at work, looking for first regular job, and unemployed) as a percentage of the total population._

#####Overall Male v Female

The range of values were found to be:-

- Female: 70.7% (Limerick City) to 79.0% (Dublin City).
- Male: 84.4% (Limerick City) to 94.2% (Meath).

It is to be expected that women should have lower rates given their traditional role in rearing the family.

#####Each gender separately

_Female:_ It can be seen that participation rates for females are above average in many western counties. The cities of Dublin, Waterford and Galway also have high rates.

_Male:_ There is a much more distinct urban/rural divide here. All 5 main cities have rates at or below average, while all other areas are above.

#####Technical details...

...I'll come clean. One of the main reasons for this post was to get started with mapping in D3 (an open-source javascript library used to display information online). There was quite a bit to it; if you're interested click [here](https://github.com/prockley/LabourForceParticipation_D3Mapping).
