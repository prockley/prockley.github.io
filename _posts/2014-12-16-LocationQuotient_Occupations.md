### Which Jobs are over-represented in different parts of Ireland?

##### What is being investigated?

Using Census 2011 data, the aim was to see which occupations were most over-represented in the counties and cities of Ireland. _Are some areas over-reliant on certain types of jobs?_

##### How is this measured?

Take the example of Cork City and the occupation of 'Customer Service'. For the whole of Ireland there are 22,833 Customer Service jobs out of a total 2,232,203 jobs. So people working in this sector account for about _102 jobs out of every 10,000 nationwide_.

In Cork City there are 1,656 Customer Service jobs out of a total 55,328 jobs, which equates to _299 in every 10,000 jobs_.

The ratio between these two measures is the 'Location Quotient'. So for Cork City the measure for Customer Service jobs is 299 divided by 102, giving 2.9.

### Results

##### Top 5

 Below are the areas with the most over-represented occupations. __Cork City tops the table with 2.9 times as many Customer Service employees compared to the national average__ (per 10,000 jobs).

- 2.9 - Cork City __+__ Customer Service
- 2.4 - Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown __+__ Business, media and public service professionals
- 2.3 - Mayo __+__ Skilled agricultural and related trades
- 2.2 - Laois __+__ Protective service occupations

##### ...and what about the most common jobs?

Nothing hugely insightful here... of the 34 county and city areas the top three are 'Other/not stated' (20), 'Administrative occupations' (10), and 'Skilled Agriculture & related trades (3).

Most surprising is the result for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Here the most common occupation is 'Corporate Managers and Directors'.
